<p>So what's next? Training lasts for about a month. Yes, it's intense, but you'll have fun, make some
friends, and learn a whole lot about broadcasting. The journey includes a core
training for several hours with the rest of the trainees, a few group lectures, a handful
of studio lab sessions, several demo tapes, a competency exam, and a written test.
The sessions will be scheduled around your availability. Core, the group lectures, and
final test will be on Sunday late afternoons for greatest availability.</p>
